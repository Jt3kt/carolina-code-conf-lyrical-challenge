# Lyrical Code Challenge 2023 for the Carolina Code Conference

See the [announcement blog post](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/lyrical-code-challenge-dont-stop?sd=pf) for full details!

The goal is to turn these song lyrics (below) into code in any/every language you can think of. As entries come in if you think you can improve something, feel free to submit a PR doing exactly that. Assuming we get enough entries, we're going assemble the results into our 2023 Carolina Code Conference t-shirt.

## What do you mean, song lyrics as code?

A genius of some sort created this Bohemian Rhapsody as Code t-shirt. I own one and it's a lot of fun, so we're hoping to use it as inspiration for a polyglot version of the [song chosen by our poll](https://blog.carolina.codes/p/poll-song-code-t-shirt-challenge), Don't Stop Believin'.

## How to submit a PR

To enter, fork this repo and add a directory for the language you want to use. Then create a file using the song title and your github username, like so:

```bash
# Examples

ruby/dont-stop-believin-brightball.rb

java/DontStopBelievinBrightball.java

elixir/dont-stop-believin-brightball.exs
```

Then just submit your PR! Bonus points and social media thank yous for broadcasting it and tagging us on your favorite social channels.

Remember, it's more important that the code reads than actually compiles. This is going on a t-shirt, not your production server. Above all, have fun with it.

Here's an example to get you started.

```ruby
girl = Person.new(sex: 'female', age: 18, from: 'a small town')
girl.currently_lives_in = 'a lonely world'

train = Transportation.new(type: 'train', departs_at: 'midnight', destination: 'anywhere')
girl.transport(train)

boy = Person.new(sex: 'male', age: 18, from: 'South Detroit')
boy.transport(train)
```

## Don't Stop Believin' - Journey

```
[Verse 1]
Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

[Verse 4]
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlights, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlights, people
```
